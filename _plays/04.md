Successful TechHire Communities consist of (1) a cohesive ecosystem that includes multiple relevant stakeholders in the local technology training and job-placement space, and (2) institutional support that fosters ongoing growth and improvement. The success of the TechHire initiative is measured by the number of job seekers from underrepresented backgrounds (including minorities, women, and low-income people) that get placed into in-demand, entry-level, career-path IT jobs.
