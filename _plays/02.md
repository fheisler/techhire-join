title: The TechHire Ecosystem
---

A TechHire Hub is a region-wide collaboration of state and local public sector (e.g., governors, mayors, county executives), local/regional employers and industry groups, higher education and training institutions, technology associations, and important community-based and civic organizations.

One local organization - with a strong reputation in both the business and educational communities â€“ serves as TechHire Hub Operator, convening regional TechHire partners, facilitating goal setting, and tracking progress.

The TechHire network is comprised of TechHire Hub Operators, committed employers, educational and civic institutions across the 50+ TechHire hubs, and a growing set of national partners.
