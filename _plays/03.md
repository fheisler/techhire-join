title: Enlisting Employers
---

Employers are experiencing difficulty hiring skilled IT workers: compared to 2010, time to fill IT roles takes five additional weeks. By 2020, there is an expectation that there will be 1 million more IT jobs than computer science students in the United States. And these open jobs cut across industries, with two of three open IT jobs in industries outside of tech, including health, financial services, retail, and manufacturing. Working together with other employers in the local community, collectives of employers can signal to job seekers and training providers which skills are required for local jobs and provide feedback on which programs are producing quality candidates. By aligning with other employers, the collective group can build an ecosystem with a larger supply of quality IT talent.
