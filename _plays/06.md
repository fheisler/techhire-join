### Checklist

- Define and collect metrics to monitor progress on shared goals and to learn and make improvements to the system over time
 - Building on the shared TechHire goals, define key TechHire job placement metrics such as the number of candidates placed into jobs, demographics of candidates who are getting placed, specific job and skill needs that are being filled, retention, and scaled employer feedback on the quality of the placements
 - Develop mechanisms to collect data at two key points in time:
  - At the time of hire: this data can come from the hiring channel (e.g. training provider, onramps, TH.org, job boards), or from the employer 
  - 6 months after the hire: Information on retention and scaled employer feedback the success of the hire necessarily must be collected from employers
- Share this data with TH.org through APIs so that TH.org can aggregate this information to provide better market signals and insights
- On an ongoing basis, collect information from employers about their changing skill needs and share with partners.
