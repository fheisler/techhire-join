title: Infrastructure for Validation and Matching
---

As described at the start of this playbook, the main goal of TechHire is to create opportunity for individuals. This is accomplished through two primary activities: 1) training job seekers for IT jobs and 2) enabling employers to hire based on abilities rather than traditional credentials. In order for this to be achieved at scale, there is a need for a trusted, low-cost method for validating the skills of job seekers and "matching" them to job opportunities. In the absence of such a solution, employers will continue to depend on college credentials, employment history, and other traditional screens to filter and select among the large number of applications they receive.

Validation and matching can be accomplished through a combination of offline and online job marketplaces, assessments, training provider validation, and analytical tools. Alternatively, or in addition, a community can facilitate the development of hiring onramps. Hiring onramps are organizations that centralize some of the above activities within a single organization: they conduct assessments, validate skills, understand employer needs, and match talent to job openings.  

The TechHire.org platform is building many of the components of validation and matching, described below. We recommend that if you have not already built out these components in your ecosystem, please leverage the TechHire.org platform.  But where you have built out components and they are working well, please share your learnings.  

### Checklist:

<p class="expander" data-expander-target="#marketplace5">
  Job marketplaces
</p>
<ul id="marketplace5">
  <li>Offline job marketplaces are standard career fairs and meet-ups where job seekers and employers can come meet each other</li>
  <li>An online job marketplace or job board is a place where: (1) job seekers can post their skills profiles and portfolio of work to be searched by employers; and (2) employers can post their job posting and skills needs to be searched by job seekers.</li>
</ul>

<p class="expander" data-expander-target="#assess5">
  Assessments for job seekers to demonstrate their skills and fit
</p>
<ul id="assess5">
  <li>There are broadly four categories of skills that employers would like to assess: (1) general intelligence; (2) IT occupation-specific hard skills (e.g. Java programming); (3) soft skills like teamwork, grit, communication; (4) organizational culture fit</li>
  <li>TechHire.org has developed a rubric for determining which assessments will be most effective in allowing job seekers to convincingly signal their competencies to employers. The assessments should (in random order):
    <ul>
      <li>Have strong employer ("face") validity</li>
      <li>Be attractive and easy to use for job seekers</li>
      <li>Satisfy legal / regulatory conditions (e.g. EEOC "4/5ths" rule)</li>
      <li>Allow job seeker to own their assessments scores and results</li>
      <li>Be easily deployable at scale</li>
      <li>Be supported by sound underlying cognitive psychology research</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="expander" data-expander-target="#channels5">
  Training provider "hiring channels" â€“ a list of training providers and intermediaries from which employers can hire quality candidates
</p>
<ul id="channels5">
  <li>Talk to employers to understand which training providers have a successful track record of placing candidates</li>
  <li>These "validated" training providers should be part of the TechHire network and can serve as a source of quality candidates</li>
  <li>Partner with these training providers to direct their students to create profiles on the job board and / or coordinate job fairs around course completion / graduation</li>

<p class="checked">
  A hiring onramp is an intermediary that combines many of the above components within one organization. An effective onramp can validate skills on one end, understand employer needs on the other end, and then perform the crucial activity of matching job seekers to the best opportunity.  An onramp may have their own job seekers and employer networks or can take advantage of the networks being created on the TechHire.org platform.
