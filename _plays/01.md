Originally announced by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/technology/techhire" target="_blank">President Obama in 2015</a> as a public-private initiative in 21 pilot communities, TechHire has become a rapidly growing national movement in 50+ U.S. cities, states, and rural regions.

TechHire expands job opportunity and economic growth by enabling regional employers to fill hundreds of thousands of entry-level, career-path, skilled tech jobs, by hiring trained job seekers with the ability to do the job - but who are overlooked by typical hiring practices and/or underrepresented in the IT field.
