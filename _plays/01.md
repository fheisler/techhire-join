Shared goals
</h3>

<span class="content" id="share-goals">
The main goal of TechHire is to create opportunity for individuals. This is accomplished through two primary activities: 1) training job seekers for IT jobs and 2) enabling employers to hire based on abilities rather than traditional credentials. TechHire partners in your community including employers, training providers, and other intermediaries should provide input on a shared set of targets as well as additional goals that may be important for your local TechHire.
</span>

<ul class="content" id="share-goals">
<li>Hiring: How many TechHire job placements will you aim to reach across all employers and partners this year?</li>
<li>Training: Working backwards from your placements goals, how many job seekers will you aim to train this year through TechHire training providers, existing and new?</li>
<li>Job Seeker Outreach: In order to meet your hiring and training goals, how many total potential job seekers do you aim to reach this year?</li>
<li>Specific segments of job seekers: Do partners in your community have goals related to reaching or training specific segments of job seekers?</li>
</ul>

Alignment on roles
</h3>

<span id="align-roles">
- Employer engagement
- Job seeker outreach and training
- Validation and matching
- Metrics and data collection â€“ Who is responsible for collecting and aggregating data to track progress towards goals? It is important to have an organization playing this role. And it should be clear to all partners what data will be made public and in what form. It is helpful, though not necessary, if the same organization that is collecting information on outcomes to provide to job seekers is also collecting and aggregating data on progress towards goals.

Resources
</h3>

<span id="resources">
The work of TechHire cannot be accomplished without dedicated resources to facilitate the overall effort and to broaden access to accelerated training for individuals who would not otherwise have the opportunity to gain new skills.
- TechHire initiative coordination
