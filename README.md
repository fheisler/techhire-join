### Running the Site Locally

To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need to install Jekyll and other dependencies:

If you don't already have Ruby and Bundler installed, follow [the first two steps in these Jekyll installation instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#installing-jekyll "Installation instructions for Jekyll").

Next, [fork this repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ "Instructions for Forking Your Repository") and clone it on your computer.

Navigate to the folder on your computer, and run the command `$ bundle install` at the command line prompt.

To run the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to preview the site.

### Editing the Stylesheets

This project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Link to Learn More About Sass") for managing its style sheets. These styles are defined in the [`styles.scss` file](assets/_sass/styles.scss). We use [Jekyll's native SASS support](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) to auto-generates the required CSS when you run the site locally, as described above.
